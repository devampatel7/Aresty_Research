## Project Description

While standing height is positively associated with blood pressure in the pediatric population, studies have suggested an inverse relationship in adults. Our goal was to analyze the age-specific association between height and pulse pressure. We analyzed 15,707 men and 16,024 women who were at least 20 years old and not taking antihypertensive medication. We used the data from the National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES) spanning from 1999 to 2020. We grouped the dataset by dividing the standing height into quartiles.
